# Shortest-Path

Code réalisé par Paulin AVRIL, João Lucas SANTOS PENHA DE OLIVEIRA, Yaniv BENICHOU et Guillaume BAUDIN DE LA VALETTE

## Requirements 
Make sure to have the ffmpeg library and the graphviz library before compiling , we use it to produce videos from generated PNG files by Dijkstra Algorithm. 

>sudo apt-get install ffmpeg  
>sudo apt install graphviz 

## How to execute
In order to test our code , we have makeFiles as you can just do , on the ~/Shortest-Path/ :

### Execution : 
>make   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #To produce programme1.exe, programme2.exe, tests.exe

>make programme1   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #To produce only programme1.exe 

>make programme2   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #To produce only programme2.exe 

>make tests   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #To produce only tests.exe

### Cleaning :
>make clean   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #To clean  programme1.exe, programme2.exe, tests.exe

>make clean_programme1   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #To clean only  programme1.exe 

>make clean_programme2   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #To clean only  programme2.exe 

>make clean_tests   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #To clean only tests.exe

### Cleaning output : 
>make mrproper   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #To clean all the ouputs files on every folders

>make mrproper_programme1   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #To clean all the ouputs files on programme1/ folder

>make mrproper_programme2   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #To clean all the ouputs files on programme2/ folder

>make mrpropoer_tests   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #To clean all the outputs files on programm2/ folder

### Although we can compile everything from ~/Shortest-Path/, please run from each directory, where the commands make,make clean or make mrproper are equivalent to previous ones, but will affect only the current directory.

## Programme 1
In the ~/programme1/ repertory :

> make   

Then

> ./programme1.exe --filename --source --destination

where:

--filename: represents the location of the .adj file <br>
--source: represents the initial node <br>
--destination: represents the node of destination <br>

it will create .dot files and .png files in the output/filename/ directory, where filename is the name of the file placed in the input.
You can also change the definition of the DOT_PATH constant by commenting on line 4 of the file ../include/treatmentFiles.h. that way, the program will only display the result of the path, without creating any file.

### Exemple 1

>./programme1.exe input/graph1.adj 0 7

if DOT_PATH is defined, the program will create 9 dot files and 9 png files in the output/dotFiles/graph1 and output/pngFiles/graph1 directories. Containing the information of all the stages to find the path of all the node. <br>
Also,the distance and the path between the nodes 0 and 7 will be displayed on the terminal.

### Exemple 2

>./programme1.exe input/graph1.adj 0 -all

similarly to the previous example, the code will produce the same files however the program will display all possible paths from the start node 0

## Programme 2
on the  ~/programme2/ repertory : 
> make 
Then
> ./programme2.exe --out --in --filename

Where:

--filename: represents the location of the .adj file <br>
--out: represents the output format, there are 3 possibilities : -dot, -adj, -la <br>
--in: represents the initial file format, there are 2 possibilities: -a, -l <br>
### Exemple 1

>./programme2.exe -dot -a input/adj/graph1.adj

In this case, the program will create the output/dot/graph1.dot file and output/png/graph1.png containing the information of the graph from the input/adj/graph1.adj 
### Exemple 2

>./programme2.exe -dot -l input/la/graph1.la

In this case, the program will create the output/dot/graph1.dot file and output/png/graph1.png containing the information of the graph from the input/la/graph1.la 

### Exemple 3

>./programme2.exe -la -a input/adj/graph1.adj

In this case, the program will create the output/la/graph1.la file containing the information from the input/adj/graph1.adj . but in the adjacent list format

### Exemple 4

>./programme2.exe -adj -l input/la/graph1.la

In this case, the program will create the output/adj/graph1.adj file containing the information from the input/la/graph1.la . but in the adjacent matrix format


## Tests
Dans le repertoir ~/tests/ :

> make

Puis

> ./tests

By doing this code, the program will display a sequence of results obtained from calls from program 1 and program 2, from randomly generated .adj files.
During the tests, .adj files will be generated in the input/ folder. And since programs 1 and 2 will be used, the files generated by both programs will be stored in the output folder, where you can see all types and files generated from the files belonging to the input/
After performing a certain amount of testing, the program will do a mass test using only the dijkstra code, making it process matrix up to 400 nodes. The durations of this process are then stored, and later used to create a .png file, in the output/graphic/
